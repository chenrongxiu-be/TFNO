# TFNO
This repository provides the official implementation of the paper:

* TFNO: Real-time surrogate model of vehicle-bridge interaction based on a novel multiple-input neural operator

In this work, we propose a novel multiple-input neural operator, TFNO, which integrates the Transformer architecture with the Fourier Neural Operator. TFNO is developed as a surrogate model for the vehicleâ€“bridge interaction system, enabling accurate and real-time prediction of bridge dynamic deflection responses.

## Requirements
The implementation is based on Python with the following dependencies:
* numpy, pytorch, einops, matplotlib

## Usage
**1. Data preparation**

Download the datasets from the provided URL and place them in the ./data/ directory, e.g., ./data/continuous.

**2. Model training**

Take TFNO training as an example:

1. Configure model architecture, training setups, and dataset, etc. in ./config/config_tfno.ini*.
2. Configure already-provided node_num, target_datasets, target_node, and target_axis in train_tfno.py, . 
2. Run train_tfno.py

**The configuration files (.ini) included in this repository correspond to the experimental setups reported in the paper.*

**Optional: transfer learning**

To enable transfer learning after pre-training:

1. In ./config/config_tfno.ini, set transfer_learning = true and specify title_pretrain.
2. In train_tfno.py, configure already-provided node_num, target_datasets, target_node, and target_axis.
3. Run train_tfno.py

**3. Visualization (evaluation):**
1. Adjust evaluation configurations in plot.py.
2. Run plot.py

## Datasets
The datasets used in the paper are provided in .npy (NumPy array) format and are directly loadable within the scripts.
